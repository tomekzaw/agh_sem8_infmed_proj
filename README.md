# IoMT app

**This project has been realised as final assignment for "Medical informatics" course on AGH University of Science and Technology.**

The mobile app has been implemented in React Native and currently it covers the following functionalities:

- scanning for IoMT devices using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE),
- establishing a connection with selected device,
- gathering medical signals from IoMT devices in realtime,
- recording the signal and saves data in device's filesystem,
- sending recordings using operating system sharing functionality.

For demonstration purposes, a IoMT device mock has been implemented as well in Node.js. Once the Bluetooth LE connection is established, it transmits a pre-recorded ECG signal in batches.

Once the switch is toggled, the app will start scanning for IoMT devices nearby.

When any device is detected, its name and identifier will be visible.

If Bluetooth adapter is turned off, the following alert will show up.

**Note:** On Android it is also necessary to enable location services.

When a device is selected, the connection will be established and the app will read the signal from the device.

You may start recording anytime.

Once you stop the recording, the data will be saved to a file `iomt_{date}_{time}.csv` on your device.

Then it is possible to share the file using native sharing functionality of your device's operating system.

When deleting the recording, the app will ask you to confirm.

Once the file is deleted, the success message will show up.
