# IoMT app

This app:

- scans for IoMT devices using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE),
- establishes a connection with selected device,
- gathers medical signals from IoMT devices in realtime,
- records the signal and saves data in device's filesystem,
- sends recordings using operating system sharing functionality.

For demonstration purposes, a BLE mock for MacOS has been implemented, which transmits a pre-recorded ECG signal.

## Demo

Once the switch is toggled, the app will start scanning for IoMT devices nearby.

When any device is detected, its name and identifier will be visible.

If Bluetooth adapter is turned off, the following alert will show up.

When a device is selected, the connection will be established and the app will read the signal from the device.

You may start recording anytime.

Once you stop the recording, the data will be saved to a file `iomt_{date}_{time}.csv` on your device.

Then it is possible to share the file using native sharing functionality of your device's operating system.

When deleting the recording, the app will ask you to confirm.

Once the file is deleted, the success message will show up.
